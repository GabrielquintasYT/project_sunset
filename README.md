# **WELCOME**
This is the official repository for my future project codenamed "Project Sunset". It will be a 2D pixel-art 80's neo-styled action/combat videogame. Everything I do here is going to be used in the future to save all of my content and share my devlogs.

Currently, I have started working on the main storyboard and the first characters for the game. I am also working on multiple documents to use for future videogame use and company projections. Speaking of companies,

I have started working on this new videogame studio called YAGADA Game Development Studio, where all of my projects, including a lot of assets, videogames, franchises, marketing, etc. are thrown under this name. This repository will live for years to come and will serve purpose to store everything I have to offer for the videogame industry. I have also studied that the videogame industry is much more valuable (grossing over 200 billion) than the music and entertainment industry COMBINED. I want to take this chance as soon as possible and deliver what I have to offer. I hope everyone enjoys what I will create, possibly creating the story of a lifetime. Who knows.

I miss actually playing a game, or even seeing a marketed game that isn't owned by some of the greediest corporations alive. Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, CapCom, Activision, just to name a few. I hate the idea of these stupid people taking over the industry just because they made a 90% metacritic-rated title one decade ago. Utterly absurd how so many aspiring creators are always twenty steps below, meanwhile the companies who have the power to pump out piles of shit every month get piles of cash in return every single time, thanks to mindless "fans". Take notes, Ubisoft.

Overall, I hate to be yapping all and all about this, but it is definitely a topic I want to discuss here, and how I want to share my progress with the world. As it gets more developed, more confidential it becomes.

Thank you for reading.
